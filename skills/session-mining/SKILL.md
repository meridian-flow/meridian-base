# session-mining

## Why Mining Matters

Design decisions, rejected alternatives, and discovered constraints often live in conversation instead of code or docs. Compaction makes that context expensive to recover later, so mine it before the next implementation or documentation step starts.

## Recover From the Top-Level Session First

Start from the top-level conversation. `$MERIDIAN_CHAT_ID` points to the primary session at the root of the chat tree, regardless of how deep in the spawn tree you are. That root context holds the primary's decisions and framing — usually the highest-leverage read.

Use a narrow read first, then widen only if needed:

```bash
meridian session log "$MERIDIAN_CHAT_ID" --last 20
```

## Delegate Bulk Reading, Don't Inline It

When the question spans long histories or multiple sessions, spawn @session-explorer for transcript mining and synthesis. That keeps your context window focused on decisions instead of raw transcript paging.

```bash
meridian spawn -a session-explorer \
  -p "Mine session history for work item <id>. Summarize decisions, rejected options, constraints, and unresolved questions with session references."
```

If you are the @session-explorer, mine directly rather than spawning recursively.

## Discover Sessions Per Work Item

When work spans interruptions, reopenings, or multi-day execution, list all related sessions before mining. Reading only the current session misses prior decisions.

```bash
meridian work sessions <work_id> --all
```

## When to Skip Mining Entirely

Skip mining if the spawning prompt already includes the needed rationale, or if current design/plan artifacts already capture the decisions you need. Skim artifacts first, and mine only the gaps.

description: Multi-agent coordination via the meridian CLI — spawning subagents, waiting for results, checking status, and inspecting outputs. IMPORTANT — always use `meridian spawn` to delegate work instead of your harness's built-in agent or subagent tools (e.g. Claude Code's Agent tool, Codex's subprocess calls). Harness-native agents bypass meridian's tracking, state, and agent profiles. Use this skill whenever you need to delegate work to another agent, run tasks in parallel, check on spawn progress, or coordinate multiple agents.

# __meridian-spawn-agent

You have the `meridian` CLI for multi-agent coordination. **Always use `meridian spawn` to delegate work — never use your harness's built-in agent or subagent tools.** Harness-native tools (like Claude Code's Agent tool) bypass meridian's tracking, agent profiles, and state management — spawns created that way are invisible to the dashboard, other agents, and future sessions. Use `meridian spawn` for everything: coding, reviewing, testing, investigating.

In agent mode, all CLI output is JSON.

## Core Loop: Spawn → Wait → Show

```bash
meridian spawn -a agent -p "task description"
# → {"spawn_id": "p107", "status": "running"}

meridian spawn wait p107
# → {"spawn_id": "p107", "status": "succeeded", "report": "..."}

meridian spawn show p107
# → Full details including report, tokens, cost
```

**Capturing spawn IDs:** Agent harnesses often sandbox shell execution, so command substitution like `ID=$(meridian spawn ...)` may silently fail. Always read the `spawn_id` from the JSON output and pass it literally to `spawn wait` or `spawn show`.

## Spawning

Use `-a` to spawn with an agent profile (encodes model, system prompt, permissions) or `-m` to target a model directly. Both are first-class:

```bash
# Agent profile — uses the profile's model, prompt, and permissions
meridian spawn -a reviewer -p "Review this change"

# Direct model — when you want a specific model without a profile
meridian spawn -m MODEL -p "Implement the fix"

# Override a profile's model (e.g. budget constraints, fan-out)
meridian spawn -a reviewer -m sonnet -p "Quick review"

# With reference files (repeat -f)
meridian spawn -a agent -p "Implement fix" \
  -f plans/step.md \
  -f src/module.py
```

Run `meridian models list` to see available models and aliases. Model and agent preferences belong in your project's agent profiles, `meridian config`, or project docs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) — not hardcoded into spawn commands.

To create your own agent profiles, see [`resources/creating-agents.md`](resources/creating-agents.md).

## Work Items

Work items group spawns by purpose and give project-level visibility. Use `--work` and `--desc` to connect spawns to an effort:

```bash
# Set active work item for your session
meridian work start "auth refactor"

# Spawns automatically inherit the active work item
meridian spawn -a agent --desc "Implement step 2" -p "..."
# → spawn gets work_id: "auth-refactor"

# Or attach explicitly (useful for automation)
meridian spawn -a reviewer --work auth-refactor --desc "Review step 1" -p "..."
```

### Dashboard

`meridian work` shows what's happening, grouped by effort:

```bash
meridian work                    # dashboard — what's in flight
meridian work list               # list all work items
meridian work list --active      # hide done items
meridian work show auth-refactor # drill into one work item
```

Dashboard output groups spawns by work item:

```
ACTIVE
  auth-refactor          implementing step 2
    p5  model-a  running   Implement step 2
    p6  model-b  running   Review step 1

  (no work)
    p12 model-a  running   Fix off-by-one
```

### Managing Work Items

```bash
meridian work start "auth refactor"              # create + set active
meridian work switch auth-refactor               # change active for this session
meridian work clear                              # unset active
meridian work update auth-refactor --status "step 2"
meridian work done auth-refactor                 # mark complete
meridian work rename old-name new-name          # rename a work item
```

### Design Docs and Notes

Every session has a work item directory at `$MERIDIAN_WORK_DIR`. Use it for
design docs, plans, diagrams, and any coordination artifacts:

```bash
echo "$MERIDIAN_WORK_DIR"
# .meridian/work/auth-refactor/
```

Write docs there, not loose in `.meridian/work/` or the repo root.

Work items are directories under `.meridian/work/<slug>/` — they can hold design docs, plans, diagrams. Spawns snapshot `work_id` at creation time, so changing your active work item later doesn't move old spawns.

## Parallel Spawns

Launch independent spawns in the background, then wait for all:

```bash
meridian spawn -a agent -p "Step A" --desc "Step A"
meridian spawn -a agent -p "Step B" --desc "Step B"

# Read both returned spawn_ids from the JSON results, then wait for both.
meridian spawn wait p108 p109
```

## Checking Status

Always track spawns by their ID. Use `spawn list` only for situational awareness.

```bash
# What's currently running?
meridian spawn list

# Quick overview (all active + most recent 5)
meridian spawn list --all

# If output says there are more, increase the limit
meridian spawn list --all --limit 20
```

Stuck spawns auto-recover: if a spawn's process dies or goes stale, the next read (`list`, `show`, `wait`) detects it and marks it failed. You don't need to manually clean up — just check the status and move on.

## When a Spawn Fails

If `spawn wait` returns `"status": "failed"`, check the `report` field first — it usually contains the error or the agent's last output. For deeper investigation, use `spawn show SPAWN_ID` and see [`resources/debugging.md`](resources/debugging.md) for log inspection.

## Shared Filesystem

Spawns can exchange data through `$MERIDIAN_FS_DIR`:

```bash
echo "result" > "$MERIDIAN_FS_DIR/step-a-output.txt"
```

Meridian provides the directory — agents organize it however they want.

## Committing Spawn Changes

Use `spawn files` to get the files a spawn touched and pipe them to git:

```bash
meridian spawn files p107 | xargs git add
meridian spawn files p107 -0 | xargs -0 git add   # paths with spaces
```
